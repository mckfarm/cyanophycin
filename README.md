# Cyanophycin metabolism exploration

This repository contains workflows and code for the exploration of cyanophycin metabolism in wastewater microbiomes. 
The bulk of the analysis work was supported through the computational resources and staff contributions provided for the Quest high performance computing facility at Northwestern University which is jointly supported by the Office of the Provost, the Office for Research, and Northwestern University Information Technology.
See workflow documents folder more detailed descriptions of each of the main analyses.
